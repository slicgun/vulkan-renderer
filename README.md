Vulkan/OpenGL Renderer

plan is to make a vulkan/opengl renderer and then eventually a game engine
for now:
  i have taken the code from https://vulkan-tutorial.com/ and put into my own project with some minor changes
  changed the code to use the c++ bindings (vulkan.hpp)
  and now i am in the process of abstracting the vulkan code into classes etc...
 
 please note that the code here is much poorer quality than i would normally write (no pointer checks, little validation, bad logging, etc...) - i intend on fixing these problems once i fully abstract the learn-vulkan examples
